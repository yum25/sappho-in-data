Close to me now as I pray,
lady Hera, may your gracious form appear,
to which the sons of Atreus prayed,
glorious kings.

They won very many prizes
first at Troy then on the sea
and set out for here but
could not complete the road

until they called on you and Zeus of suppliants
and Thyoneâ€™s lovely child.
Now be gentle and help me too
as of old[

Holy and beautiful
maiden

to be
