]for my mother

in her youth it was a great
ornament if someone had hair
bound with purple—

a very great ornament indeed
But for the one who has hair yellower
than a pinetorch

crowns
of blooming flowers
and just lately a headbinder

spangled from Sardis
]cities

but for you Kleis I have no
spangled—where would I get it?—
headbinder: yet the Mytilinean[
] [
]to hold
]spangled
these things of the Kleanaktidai
exile
memories terribly leaked away
